# MongoDB-ODM-PHP
MongoDB Simple ODM
This package can be used to store and retrieve objects in MongoDB databases.
The main class can load model classes of objects from a given directory, so the objects can be used to store and retrieve information from a given MongoDB database records.
The model objects extend the base MongoDB table class so they define the properties, relationships and indexes of the database records that will be mapped to objects the the model classes.
The model classes can perform operations like saving an object, finding objects by a given criteria and remove objects from the database.
